# Introduction

The Florida Anole Species Classification project aims to develop a robust machine learning pipeline for identifying five common Anolis species from photographs, primarily to support a community science initiative with middle school students in Miami. Building upon an extensive dataset of over 80,000 verified iNaturalist photographs, this project seeks to improve the current classification system, which, despite having access to substantial training data, currently achieves only 35% accuracy (compared to a random baseline of 20%). The development of this classification pipeline will serve as the foundation for a broader educational tool, whether implemented as a mobile application or web platform, that enables students to receive immediate probability-based species identification feedback before submitting their observations to iNaturalist, thereby enhancing the quality of citizen science data collection while engaging young students in herpetological research. 

## Method 
The improved classification system proposes a pipeline that consists of 
1) Detecting lizard species using fine-tuned lizard detection model ( :point_left: Current Progress)
2) Upscaling and enhancing cropped image 
3) Classifying lizard subspecies using Classification model trained with cropped images.

## Installation:
    cd Anole_classifier
    
    conda create -f requirements_window.yml
    conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1.0
    pip install "tensorflow<2.11" 

## Dataset
Prepare your dataset and ensure it is organized as specified in the Dataset section. To download the raw, labelled images from iNaturalist:

The dataset used for this project consists of labeled images of different anole species. The dataset should be organized into subfolders for each species, with images in each subfolder. To download the dataset: 
1. Download the .csv file (Contains the taxonID, link, image metadata) 
2. Use the utility.py file. 
 - The file path must be changed to one of the csv files and the invoktion uncommented.

Generate dataset .csv file using the following steps:
 - navigate to iNaturalist export: https://www.inaturalist.org/observations/export
 - use queries: ?quality_grade=research&identifications=any&field%3Abanded=yes&taxon_ids%5B%5D=36488%2C36391%2C36455, ?quality_grade=research&identifications=any&field%3Abanded=yes&taxon_ids%5B%5D=116461%2C36514
